# Rafael Maria Friebe, PhD

Independent researcher working at the intersection of psychology, philosophy, and digital culture, with a focus on questions of agency and responsibility under technological mediation.

I develop conceptual frameworks for agency and responsibility that speak across digital humanities, media theory, and depth/phenomenological psychology.
My work examines how subjectivity, ethical responsibility, and forms of agency are shaped under conditions of algorithmic mediation, technological rationality, and persistent inner conflict—conditions in which neither mastery nor resolution can be assumed. 
Contemporary life increasingly unfolds within procedural and algorithmically mediated environments that privilege optimization, control, and coherence.
Against this backdrop, my research approaches agency not as mastery or completion, but as a form of responsibility exercised within enduring limits. Drawing on psychology, philosophy, and symbolic theory, I investigate how subjectivity is formed where necessity persists despite insight or effort, and how freedom can be understood as the capacity to remain in conscious relation to what cannot simply be overcome.

## Research Orientation
I approach freedom not as mastery or resolution, but as the capacity to bear necessity under conditions where conflict, limitation, and persistence are structurally unavoidable.

Rather than treating psychic or cultural constraints as problems to be optimized away, my work understands them as forms of address that demand ongoing responsibility. Agency, on this view, is exercised not through control, coherence, or completion, but through the sustained and reflective manner in which what persists is lived. This orientation situates freedom within limits rather than beyond them, emphasizing responsibility without appealing to voluntarist, therapeutic, or heroic notions of autonomy.
