# Rafael Maria Friebe, PhD
Independent researcher and filmmaker working at the intersection of Digital Humanities, film practice, analytical psychology, and media theory.

My work examines contemporary media cultures as symbolic environments in which identity, conflict, and agency are negotiated under digital and algorithmic conditions. I am particularly interested in how narrative and visual structures render inner tensions perceptible — not as metaphysical claims, but as aesthetic and cultural configurations.

Drawing on analytical psychology in a methodologically restrained manner, I use Jungian concepts as descriptive constraints rather than explanatory or therapeutic frameworks. Analytical language serves to articulate configurations of rupture, persistence, and ego-limitation as they emerge in contemporary technological contexts. The approach remains non-clinical and non-teleological.

Social-psychological and media-theoretical perspectives function as external limiting frameworks, grounding symbolic analysis in social structure, collective dynamics, and material mediation. Rather than synthesizing these idioms into a unified theory, my work maintains their tensions as analytically productive.

## Film, Symbolic Structure, and Digital Mediation

My long-term professional practice in filmmaking informs this perspective. Film operates as a site where symbolic structures become visible in embodied form — in gesture, silence, framing, rhythm, and spatial tension. Contemporary cinema continues to draw on mythic narrative grammars — crisis, descent, confrontation, transformation — yet these function as aesthetic architectures rather than spiritual doctrines.

In my practice-based work, narrative rupture and psychological destabilization are treated as structural events. A single moment of fracture can reorganize identity, perception, and relational space. Transformation is not presented as awakening or resolution, but as reconfiguration under pressure.

Digital and AI-mediated production environments intensify these dynamics. Algorithmic systems shape visibility, pacing, and affective circulation. I therefore investigate how cinematic form, branding environments, and computational mediation participate in processes of symbolic orientation and identity formation.

My research is concerned with responsibility and constraint — with the endurance of subjectivity where integration or individuation cannot be presupposed. The work remains descriptive by design, concerned with structure and implication rather than prescription.

## Research Orientation
I approach freedom not as mastery or resolution, but as the capacity to bear necessity under conditions where conflict, limitation, and persistence are structurally unavoidable.

Rather than treating psychic or cultural constraints as problems to be optimized away, my work understands them as forms of address that demand ongoing responsibility. Agency, on this view, is exercised not through control, coherence, or completion, but through the sustained and reflective manner in which what persists is lived. This orientation situates freedom within limits rather than beyond them, emphasizing responsibility without appealing to voluntarist, therapeutic, or heroic notions of autonomy.

## Core Concepts and Themes

- Symbolic structures in contemporary media cultures
- Narrative rupture and identity reconfiguration
- Film as embodied symbolic articulation
- Digital and AI-mediated subject formation
- Freedom as responsibility under necessity
- Limits of agency in algorithmic environments

## Selected Publications & Preprints

My research develops a non-teleological, depth-psychological account of agency under digitally mediated conditions. Across theoretical, cultural, and applied contexts, the work examines how symbolic structures organize subjectivity, responsibility, and identity formation in contemporary media environments.
