# Rafael Maria Friebe, PhD
Independent researcher examining digital subjectivity through analytically informed, socially constrained, and methodologically non-teleological psychological description.

I am an independent researcher working at the intersection of Digital Humanities, analytical psychology, social psychology, and cultural theory, with a particular focus on digital and algorithmically mediated forms of subjectivity.

My work is theoretical and conceptual in orientation and proceeds under conditions of deliberate methodological restraint. Drawing on analytical psychology in the tradition of the Society of Analytical Psychology, I employ Jungian concepts as descriptive constraints rather than explanatory or teleological frameworks. Analytical-psychological language serves to articulate configurations of symbolic tension, ego-positioning, and psychic limitation as they become perceptible in contemporary cultural and technological environments. The approach remains non-clinical and structurally analytic.

Social-psychological and media-theoretical perspectives function as external limiting frameworks, grounding symbolic analysis in social structure, collective dynamics, institutional conditions, and material mediation. Rather than synthesizing these idioms into a unified theory, my work maintains their differences as analytically productive tensions.

A central focus of my research lies in the examination of digital and AI-influenced media cultures as symbolic systems. I investigate how narrative structures, visual forms, branding environments, and computational mediation participate in processes of identity formation, symbolic orientation, and cultural meaning-making. My long-term professional practice in filmmaking and media production informs this perspective, enabling a practice-sensitive analysis of visual and narrative structures in digital contexts.

## Research Orientation
I approach freedom not as mastery or resolution, but as the capacity to bear necessity under conditions where conflict, limitation, and persistence are structurally unavoidable.

Rather than treating psychic or cultural constraints as problems to be optimized away, my work understands them as forms of address that demand ongoing responsibility. Agency, on this view, is exercised not through completion or coherence, but through the sustained and reflective manner in which structural conditions are inhabited. This orientation situates freedom within limits rather than beyond them and reframes subjectivity as a site of responsibility under technologically mediated conditions.
