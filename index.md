# Rafael Maria Friebe, PhD
Independent researcher working at the intersection of Digital Humanities, analytical psychology, social psychology, and cultural theory, with a particular focus on digital and algorithmically mediated forms of subjectivity.

My research is theoretical and conceptually rigorous, proceeding under conditions of deliberate methodological restraint. Drawing on analytical psychology in the tradition of the Society of Analytical Psychology, I employ Jungian concepts as descriptive constraints rather than explanatory, therapeutic, or teleological frameworks. Analytical language serves to articulate configurations of symbolic tension, ego-positioning, and psychic limitation as they become perceptible in contemporary cultural and technological environments. The work remains non-clinical and structurally analytic.

Social-psychological and media-theoretical perspectives function as external limiting frameworks, grounding symbolic analysis in social structure, institutional conditions, collective dynamics, and material mediation. Rather than synthesizing these idioms into a unified theory, my approach maintains their differences as analytically productive tensions.

A central focus of my research lies in digital and AI-influenced media cultures as symbolic systems. I examine how narrative structures, visual forms, branding environments, and computational mediation participate in processes of identity formation and cultural meaning-making. My long-term professional practice in filmmaking and media production informs this perspective, enabling a practice-sensitive analysis of cinematic form, symbolic communication, and digitally mediated storytelling.

## Research Orientation
I approach freedom not as mastery or resolution, but as the capacity to bear necessity under conditions where conflict, limitation, and persistence are structurally unavoidable.

Rather than treating psychic or cultural constraints as problems to be optimized away, my work understands them as forms of address that demand ongoing responsibility. Agency, on this view, is exercised not through coherence or completion, but through the sustained and reflective manner in which structural conditions are inhabited. Freedom is thus situated within limits rather than beyond them, and subjectivity is examined as a site of responsibility under technologically mediated conditions.
