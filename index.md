Independent researcher working at the intersection of digital humanities, psychology, philosophy, and digital culture, with a focus on agency, responsibility, and subjectivity under technological mediation.

My research develops conceptual frameworks for agency and responsibility that connect digital humanities and media theory with depth-oriented, interpretativ and phenomenological approaches to psychology. I examine how subjectivity, ethical responsibility, and forms of agency are shaped under conditions of algorithmic mediation, technological rationality, and procedural environments—contexts in which neither mastery, optimization, nor resolution can be assumed.

Contemporary life increasingly unfolds within systems that privilege efficiency, control, and coherence, while leaving underlying tensions unresolved. Against this backdrop, my work approaches agency not as autonomy or completion, but as responsibility exercised within enduring limits. I am particularly interested in how subjectivity is formed where conflict persists despite insight or effort, and how freedom can be understood as the capacity to remain in conscious relation to what cannot simply be overcome.

Alongside theoretical research, I place strong emphasis on academic teaching and didactic design in digitally mediated and applied higher-education contexts. My pedagogical work focuses on making scientific writing, argumentation, and assessment criteria explicit and teachable, particularly in heterogeneous Bachelor programs. I develop modular, scalable teaching frameworks that combine clear structure, formative feedback, and transparent evaluation, enabling students to build analytical clarity and academic responsibility under real institutional and time constraints.

Across research and teaching, my work is guided by a shared concern with how meaning, responsibility, and self-relation are shaped in contemporary digital environments, especially where technical systems encourage optimization while human experience remains complex.

## Research Orientation
I approach freedom not as mastery or resolution, but as the capacity to bear necessity under conditions where conflict, limitation, and persistence are structurally unavoidable.

Rather than treating psychic or cultural constraints as problems to be optimized away, my work understands them as forms of address that demand ongoing responsibility. Agency, on this view, is exercised not through control, coherence, or completion, but through the sustained and reflective manner in which what persists is lived. This orientation situates freedom within limits rather than beyond them, emphasizing responsibility without appealing to voluntarist, therapeutic, or heroic notions of autonomy.
